Q1
------------------------
Rep1: Simple rep, easy to understand and has advantage in some simple graphs.
      One segment with two points already can represent a line. 
Rep2: A little bit complicated rep, has specific methods to describe different 
      types of lines. It is better to represent some complicated graphs.
Rep3: Comparing to previous two reps. This one is too hard to use. Although one 
      Component can represent one line, but this list has infinite points inside.
      Not recommend at all if we have previous two reps.

      
Q2
--------------------------------
GitBlob:  This represent a file which is byte array type. This file method addToFile can add 
byte inside a new Blob type with certain index. Also replace method can certain indexed byte.

GitTree:  A tree in git represents a directory. This file has field two lists with GitTree and GitBlob.
This rep contains addTree and addBlob which can add tree and add blob into. getTree can get the reference of tree

GitCommit:   A commit in git represents a snapshot of your file system's history. Author name, date ,tree, message and parentCommit
inside the fields. This rep can modify message and author.
